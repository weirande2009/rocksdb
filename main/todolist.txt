5/26:
1. write a shell script that enables running multiple workloads 
at the same time. (finished on 6/3)
2. write a shell script and modify current program to make 
the write amplification of the optimal one and two baseline
algorithms collectable for the next step work.
Save the write amplification to a file for further analysis
3. write a shell script and modify current program to make
any run for a workload replayable.

6/24:
1. modify the current scripts to make the experiment run in a single "docker" （finished on 6/25）
2. run larger workloads for more information

6/28:
1. fix the bug of multi run (finished on 6/30)
2. write a script to get the overlapping ratio info of the optimal compaction of each workload

7/2:
1. Design MySQL tables to record the data of experiments.
2. Write the code to insert data to MySQL
3. Write the code to get and analyze the data in MySQL
(For the above three things, the minimum requirement is to collect the minoverlappingratio rank of 
the chosen file of each compaction)

7/9:
1. Integrate some of the shell scripts to be c++ codes.
